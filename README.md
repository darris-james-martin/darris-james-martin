### What am I looking to do? 
I became a computer scientist because I want to help people with their everyday frustrations. My career goal is to create tools for employees in order to enrich their skills and make their jobs easier. For as long as I can remember I have heard people say, “if only {points at tech} could just do {suggestion here}”. </br> 
My desire would be to turn their ideas from a frustration into a reality. In order to reach this position I am working to improve my coding skills in both front and backend development.  

### Enjoy my GitHub 
This site is used to house projects that I am proud of and have created throughout the years. I hope you find interest in what skills I have to offer.
