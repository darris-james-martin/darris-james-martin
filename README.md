### What am I looking to do?
I became a computer scientist because I want to help people with everyday frustrations. I want to make tools for employees to make their jobs and lives easier. From the moment I started working even to today, I hear people say, “if only {points at tech} could just do {suggestion here}”. My dream to make their ideas from frustration a reality.</br>
Until that day, I want to be useful in the programming industry. I want to improve my development skills and work in a front, back, or even a full stack environment.
